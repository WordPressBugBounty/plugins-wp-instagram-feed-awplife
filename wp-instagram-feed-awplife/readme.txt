The setup process takes just a few minutes. Enter your access token, adjust your display settings, and drop the shortcode wherever you want the gallery to appear. Works with pages, posts, sidebar widgets, and theme template files.

= What You Can Do With This Gallery =

When building your social media gallery, you get control over how images display:

* Choose how many photos appear (up to 50 in the free version)
* Set the number of columns from 1 to 6
* Add spacing between images for a cleaner look
* Show or hide captions on hover
* Link images back to the original post
* Open photos in a lightbox with navigation controls

The responsive design adapts automatically. Desktop visitors see a multi-column grid while mobile users get a single-column view that scrolls smoothly.

= Gallery Layout Options =

The free version includes a standard grid template. Photos arrange in equal-sized boxes across your chosen column count. Spacing options let you add gaps between images or create a tight seamless grid.

For sites needing more variety, the Pro version adds four additional layouts:

* **Masonry** – Images stack vertically without equal heights, like Pinterest
* **Mosaic** – Mixed-size tiles create visual interest
* **Carousel** – Sliding gallery with navigation arrows
* **Post Style** – Shows images with engagement data below

= Connecting Your Social Media Account =

The gallery uses Insta's official API through access tokens. This method keeps your account secure since you never enter your password into the site.

Getting an access token involves a few steps through Facebook's developer tools. We include video tutorials that walk through the process from start to finish. Most users complete setup in under 10 minutes.

= Where to Display Your Feed =

Shortcodes give you flexibility in placement. Copy the code from the gallery settings and paste it into:

* Any page or post using the block editor or classic editor
* Text widgets in your sidebar or footer
* Theme template files with the do_shortcode function

Each gallery gets its own shortcode, so you can create multiple feeds with different settings.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I get an access token? =
Access tokens are created through Facebook's developer portal. Our video tutorial walks through each step: [Watch Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEXDGIeIq_8)

= Why are my images not loading? =
Check that your access token is valid and hasn't expired. Access tokens need periodic renewal. Re-generate a new token if your current one stopped working.

= Can I display photos from multiple Insta accounts? =
The free version supports one account per gallery. Create separate galleries with different access tokens to show content from multiple accounts.

= How do I control the number of columns? =
In the gallery settings, find the columns option and select a value between 1 and 6. The layout adjusts automatically.

= Does it work with page builders like Elementor? =
Yes. Use a text or shortcode widget in your page builder and paste the gallery shortcode. The feed renders when you preview or publish.

= Will the gallery slow down my site? =
Images load from Insta's servers, not your hosting. This keeps your server resources free and typically results in fast load times.

= Can I customize the lightbox colors? =
Lightbox color options are available in the Pro version. The free version uses default styling.

= Is the gallery mobile responsive? =
Yes. The layout adapts to screen size automatically. Smaller screens show fewer columns to maintain readability.

= How many photos can I display? =
The free version allows up to 50 images per gallery. Pro users can display over 200 images with Load More pagination.

= Will I lose my galleries if I upgrade to Pro? =
Your existing galleries remain intact after upgrading. You can then access additional settings and layouts for each gallery.

= Where do I get support? =
Post questions in the [WordPress support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-instagram-feed-awplife/) or contact us through [our website](https://awplife.com/contact/).

= Does it work with private Insta accounts? =
No. Only public account posts can be fetched through the API. Switch your account to public if you want to display those photos.
